# Fullstack Developer |  Software Engineer                      

I have been developing software for over 20yrs for companies of all sizes.  I can pickup an existing project and support or enhance your current project.  Whether its a CMS like Sitecore or Episerver or just an older site that needs a digital transformation or even if its a command-line app - we can make it work.  Every line of code and docs are sent to your github or bitbucket repo.  Do you need a Azure or AWS support? Only 20-25hrs max per week.
